# Contributing to AI-BOM Inspector

Thank you for helping improve AI-BOM Inspector! Please:

1. Open an issue before large changes to align on scope.
2. Keep patches small and focused; add or update tests alongside code.
3. Run `pytest` locally; the CI workflow mirrors this.
4. Follow the existing code style (standard library only; no global try/except for imports).
5. Update documentation and examples when behavior changes.
